              "GreenTea" is an application designed to know noise levels of the BKC campus. Using data,
              that is stores, Users can know which area of the BKC campus has the least and most noise disturbance.
              This app is leaning towards to students or workers who wants peace and quiet when working

           <h2>Noise Level Map</h2> 
<br>

<dt>Simple Description</dt>
<dd>Study location finder application which would provide noise level information in public spaces within the Ritsumeikan University BKC campus.</dd>

<dt>Data Collection</dt>
<dd>Users would be able to measure noise levels inside buildings using a smartphone phone noise measurement application. This noise level data can be uploaded with the time interval data and location/building name. Processes such as averaging would be taken place on this data before being displayed on the interactive map.</dd>

<dt>Application Design</dt>
<dd>An interactive map of the BKC campus would be shown with a noise level meter above public locations indicating the noise level of that specific location. The noise level meter would also be color coded so the user can understand the general noise level without requiring the understanding of the noise level measurements. A time slider would also be included so the user can read the information at different times. At this moment the time periods would be in 90-minute intervals.</dd>

<dt>Purpose</dt>
<dd>Through this application, users who seek a quiet space to study on the campus can look for quiet locations for studying or taking Zoom lessons. The user can easily read the average noise levels for the user's desired time frame, which would give the user an understanding of the general noise levels of different locations on the campus.</dd>
<ul>
Further development possibilities
<br>
<li>We could expand the location for this application to a larger area. So the whole city's common locations can be displayed, which would give much more purpose to this application to the general public.</li>
<li>A shorter time interval can be used so the time accuracy would be increased.</li>
<li>A longer time frame can be used for users who are interested in knowing the noise levels at a later, uncommon time. </li>
</ul>

      <li>In class meeting, Group roles were discussed and documentation needed to be in a website</li>
      <li>We are required to present 3 ideas for our application after break at 10:50 A.M.</li>
      <li>Website was made using HTML</li>
      <li>Had a meeting with professor, changes are needed to be made</li>
      <li>In short, Our group needs to find a way to record the data continuously, as opposed to our original plan or just recording a standstill data</li>
      <li>Our group is stuck in a standstill currently: 10:01 A.M.</li>
      <li>We were able to proceed with our original plan with slight configurations</li>

          <dt><li>A summary about the application as of today:</li></dt>
            <dd>
              An application that can record the noise level of rooms in Ritsumeikan University, that are measured by users.
              <br>
              The application uses decibels as a measurement to know the noise level so when users want to check where they can study,
              <br>
              They can know which area or rooms have the least amount of noise.
              <br>
              To measure the noise level, There are a lot of applications that can be used available to the general public.
              <br>
              The application would be mainly based on user-generated data for reliability.
              <br>
              The application uses an interactive map of the Ritsumeikan University BKC campus to show the noise levels.
            </dd>
            <br>
      <li>Decided that our meeting would be in CC205 as of today</li>
      <li>We had a group meeting in CC205 and gathered around 14:48 P.M.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Adam has completed the requirements of the engineering process</li>
    <li>The questionnaire is still yet to be done</li>
    <li>We had a group meeting online due to KIM having on-demand classes</li>
    <br>
    Functional Requirements:
    <br>
<li>The application shall collect and store noise level data along with corresponding time intervals and location/building names.</li>
<li>The application shall perform data processing, such as averaging, on the uploaded noise level data.</li>
<li>The application shall display an interactive map of the Ritsumeikan University BKC campus.</li>
<li>The map shall indicate the noise level of each public location on the campus using a noise level meter.</li>
<li>The noise level meter shall be color-coded to provide a visual representation of the general noise level at each location.</li>
<li>The application shall include a time slider to allow users to view noise level information for different time periods.</li>
<li>The application shall provide users with the average noise levels for their desired time frames (90-minute intervals).</li>
<li>The application shall help users identify quiet locations for studying or taking Zoom lessons on campus.</li>
<br>
Non-functional Requirements:
<br>
<li>The application shall have a UI (user interface) that is easy to understand and navigate.</li>
<li>The application shall reliably collect and store noise level data without data loss.</li>
<li>The application shall handle a large volume of noise level data and display it efficiently on the map.</li>

<li>The application should allow for shorter time intervals to increase the time accuracy of noise level measurements.</li>
<li>The application should provide options for users to view noise level information for longer time frames, especially for uncommon times of the day or night.</li>
<br>
<li>We decided to refix our literature review, due to our literature not following what the assignment wants</li>
<li>Finish the requirements engineering questionnaire by Kim</li>
<li>The team wrote their weekly report individually</li>
